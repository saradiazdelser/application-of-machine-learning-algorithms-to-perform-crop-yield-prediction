# Crop Yield Prediction with Machine Learning

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the "Crop Yield Prediction" project! This research project focuses on applying machine learning algorithms to forecast crop yields, aiming to improve food security and promote sustainable agricultural practices. The project utilizes Kaggle's Crop Yield Prediction Dataset, which contains valuable information about pesticides, geographical data, and weather conditions.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Building a machine learning model for predicting crop yields that is accurate and
reliable.
- Developing an app that allows farmers to input data and receive a prediction of their
expected crop yield. 
- Understanding the factors that impact the accuracy and reliability of machine
learning algorithms in predicting crop yields. 

## Dataset

Kaggle's [Crop Yield Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset) serves as the foundation for this research. It includes a comprehensive collection of data related to . The Agricultural yield primarily depends on weather conditions (rain, temperature, etc), pesticides and information of past crop yield. The dataset is critical for training and evaluating the machine learning algorithms used in the crop yield prediction model.

## Methodology

This research involved experimentation and analysis of the data to find the most effective approach to crop yield forecasting, along with the selection and implementation of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and Gradient Boost.

## Scope and Limitations

It is essential to acknowledge that the research was based on a generalized global dataset. While the results are promising, further investigation is necessary to assess the model's performance on specific datasets, regions, and crop types. This project serves as a foundation for future studies and improvements to address the unique characteristics of different crops and environments.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- data: Contains Kaggle's [Crop Yield Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patelris/crop-yield-prediction-dataset) 
- notebooks: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the data exploration, model comparison, model training and evaluation.
